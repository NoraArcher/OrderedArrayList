# OrderedArrayList

## Breakout room discussion:
We discussed how to type into this README file.
Two hashtags will be header 2, two asterisks puts it in italics.
NoNullArrayList seems just like ArrayList but you replace a *NullPointerException* with an *IllegalArgumentException*.
We looked up *Comparable<T>* documentation because we weren't full sure how we would be sorting and the method to us is *compareTo(T o)*

## Misconceptions:
I at first had no idea what you meant by using *startingCapacity* in the constructor
We were somewhat confused about whether setting a *startingCapacity* would fill the *NoNullArrayList* will null values, but decided that it would only fill the private array inside the *ArrayList* class with nulls, not the *Arraylist* variable we were accessing.
There was also wondering whether we might use add index to accidentally include null values, but we believe *ArrayList* does not allow that.

## Alternate ideas from my group:
*no alternate ideas as of yet*
